Factory24 is the perfect fit for you, if youâ€™re passionate about identifying and nurturing next-gen innovators, entrepreneurs & creative problem solvers from Africa.

The ultimate goal of the Factory24 project is being the platform and the source of disruptive innovations in Africa to develop and build solutions that overcome current social-economic challenges, transform Africa's human capital in technology and leapfrog into the 5th industrial revolution. We aim to be a stimulus to young entrepreneurs in Africa and we welcome all who want to be a part of that.

## Course Certification Options

Over the course of each program, Factory24 runs facilitator led courses to explore the subject deeper. Although its self paced, being instructor led ensures the learning process is very hands on. weekly tasks are assigned to ensure this throughout the course. As a course participant youâ€™ll join the dedicated course whatsapp group to facilitate communication between students and the facilitator.

At the end of the course period, participants have the option to apply for a course completion certificate.
