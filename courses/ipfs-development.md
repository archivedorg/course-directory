# InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) Course

This is an IPFS introductory course. You will learn about decentralized data structures, content-based addressing, mutable file systems and more. Tasks assigned will require use of a terminal. We will be using Windows and Linux OS for development. 

IPFS, Interplanetary File System is a distributed peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol. Its designed to work as a cheaper and more efficient alternative to the HTTP protocol, addressing the common challenges associated with web centralization and its unlimited opportunities. 

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, pariticipants will learn:

* What IPFS is
* How decentralized data structures work
* Setting up an IPFS Node
* Using CID on an IPFS Project
* How IPNS differs from DNS

The interactive tutoriasl, code tests and test solutions are designed by [ProtoSchool](https://github.com/ProtoSchool) developers and contributors to introduce learners to decentralized web concepted, protocols and tools.
